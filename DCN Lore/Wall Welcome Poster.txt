Welcome to The Sunset Bar, established 2023.
This location was once a popular speakeasy in
Duskview City, but was ripped away from it's
lower scale and comfortable atmosphere when
City Management decided on installing a new
Subway Tunnel, and the newly sought out
J Platform Station Entrance, on its doorstep.

The old owners of the speakeasy moved on,
unable to maintain the original purpose and
mission of the locale.  However, business would
start flowing again due to the peaked interest and
desire of a local.  Reopened and renewed, the
location became born anew, thanks to the owner
of Lingia Manufacturing, Lingie. However decisions
to purchase the unused and seemingly derelict
location were for far more than anyone knew..

We welcome you to The Sunset Bar.

This location was restructured and renovated
by DCNorthside Construction.
