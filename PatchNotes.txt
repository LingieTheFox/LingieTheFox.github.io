<size=150%><color=#004B55>== 8/28/23 || Build V0.1.33 Optimization Pass / Spin The Bottle ==</color></size>
• <color=#FD7E53>Lingie did it.  Finally updated the world with an optimization pass.  Meshes merged, texture sizes dropped, all that noise.  You should expect higher frame rates by default now.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>We added a "Toggle Probes" button on the temporary options board at the top of the ramp at the entrance to the bar.  This will disable worldspace reflections, and can give back some frames.  Toggling Post Processing will also help!</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Riney has been hard at work on a Spin The Bottle Prefab for Sunset and other worlds going forwards.  It's basic, but it's soon to be feature rich!  Feel free to give it a go, and let Lingie know if it breaks.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Decorated the world with posters of one of our collaborators, Elevated.  They're going to push some event traffic through, so be sure to check that out!</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Various bug fixes, art differences, model updates, and sound modifications.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>("Continued to incrementally improve the art, effects, environments and sound")</color>

<size=150%><color=#004B55>== 8/28/23 || Build V0.1.30 "Reverberated Player Voices!" ==</color></size>
• <color=#FD7E53>(FINALLY) Added player voices to the reverberation effect, though intesive testing should be done.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Added bathroom sinks and updated the bar sink to be larger.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Fixed audio sources for the streaming audio sources, making them 2D rather than 3d and tiny.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Fixed local time not being spaced correctly for the text Marquee above the bar.</color>
