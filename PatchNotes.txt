• <color=#FD7E53>Marquee now shows (VIP), (Owner), and (Creator) tags, and the system was cleaned up.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Bartender Computer has calibration settings for the finger colliders, allowing you to position them better!</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Possible fix for drink sync.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Finger collider calibration in the BC, including toggle state for finger colliders, and the ability to reposition them.  Right now we're looking at one axis of movement only.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Assistant Manager should no longer crash the main script.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>DJ is automatically assigned to players who have a higher permission level than what is granted by DJ.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Finger collision should no longer push the entire button in on the drink machine.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Bar ownership transferring will actually remove BarOwnership from the previous player.  Currently there is no way to reassign owner apart from leaving the instance however.</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Fixed an oversight where the time on the scrolling text marquee above the bar would not update the actual time unless there was a staff roster change.  Whoops!</color>
• <color=#FD7E53>Various backend fixes, as well as completely unseen admin debugging tool fixes.</color>
