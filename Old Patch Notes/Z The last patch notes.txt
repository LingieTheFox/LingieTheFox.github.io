This currently is limited by songs we put in the world, but Patreon donors can send playlists and use them now!</color>\n• <color=#FD7E53>Voice ducking system.  If there is a wall between you and another person, their voice is about to get way quieter than before.  Try it out!</color>\n• <color=#FD7E53>Beer Pong, second floor of the Lounge.  Supports up to 4 players!</color>\n\n<size=150%>[ Bug Fixes ]</size>\n\n• <color=#FD7E53>Redid the entire collider system in the world to support both optimization and the new Voice Ducking.  The triangle count was reduced to under 3% of the original size.</color>\n• <color=#FD7E53>Error fixes all over inside the backend/management/console/etc.  World stability should be improved, and scripts will be far less likely to break.  (Lingie still needs to remember to push Play before uploading though :D)</color>\n• <color=#FD7E53>Backend logic fixes, and checks to ensure you can still launch a bar, even if github happens to be down or fails to send core files.</color>\n\n<size=150%>[ What's Being Worked On? ]</size>\n\n• <color=#FD7E53>Drinks are about to be a lot better.

It's been long overdue.</color>\n• <color=#FD7E53>Private Rooms.  Don't worry we didn't forget you.</color>\n• <color=#FD7E53>Drink additions, such as ice, bubbles, and garnishes.</color>
